Card games immediately strike me as something that’s had a recent resurgence while also being a popular genre long-term: Hearthstone, Slay the Spire, Artifact, Gwent, Dicey Dungeons are examples that have been around for a while and then things like Balatro and Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers have become popular recently (with Balatro especially being huge).

To me, this is immediately a fairly easy *type* of game to make given our small team size and general concerns of scope, and it would be (IMO) quite easy to bring our own USP - e.g. to my knowledge nobody has made a rhythm-based card game*? To me that seems almost obvious: throwing down a card on the beat immediately sounds satisfying, plus cards could be linked to different sequences. For example, you have to throw three in succession as a triplet and you get some modifier depending on how in-time you are + completely fail if you only had *two* cards instead of three.
