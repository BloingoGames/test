Thoughts:

Card games immediately strike me as something that’s had a recent resurgence while also being a popular genre long-term: Hearthstone, Slay the Spire, Artifact, Gwent, Dicey Dungeons are examples that have been around for a while and then things like Balatro and Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers have become popular recently (with Balatro especially being huge).

To me, this is immediately a fairly easy *type* of game to make given our small team size and general concerns of scope, and it would be (IMO) quite easy to bring our own USP - e.g. to my knowledge nobody has made a rhythm-based card game*? To me that seems almost obvious: throwing down a card on the beat immediately sounds satisfying, plus cards could be linked to different sequences. For example, you have to throw three in succession as a triplet and you get some modifier depending on how in-time you are + completely fail if you only had *two* cards instead of three.

(Bonus points if it works without sound too? More of a twitchy time-based thing than a full on musical rhythm game. Moves could be ‘coincidentally’ tied to the soundtrack)

Another point here is that card games are old as anything so just adapting/taking heavy influence an existing game (Speed comes to mind for this) would make creating a genuinely engaging system quite a lot easier. Given that we’re probably making something small, having a super fun, tight, satisfying game loop is absolutely necessary. 

 (biased maybe, I’m into rhythm games and have some experience making them).

*On a quick search I’ve only found one and it’s not really the same thing as what I’m thinking, it’s based on classical music - the cards have composers on them etc. Doesn’t even look like a rhythm game at all

## Rogue-like/lite is still huge

Roguelikes are still massive and seem to do the best in terms of these small indie games, and they make a lot of sense:

- Creating a game loop that restarts a bunch means the game can be shorter, more time to focus on mechanics
- Naturally addicting as you keep wanting to come back and get that bit further
- Fewer number of assets needed when you’re not making 100 levels
- Pretty much any genre can be implemented in this way
